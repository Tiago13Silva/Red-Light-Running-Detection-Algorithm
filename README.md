<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This code presents a new method for automatic detection of Red Light Running (RLR) violations based on video analysis and advanced artificial intelligence techniques.
The method is optimized for deployment on embedded systems and uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify and classify vehicles and the ByteTrack algorithm to track their motion, while a CNN-based classifier determines the state of traffic lights.
These components work together to detect violations by analyzing vehicle trajectories and traffic signal states within defined regions of interest.

### Built With

This app was developed using these frameworks: 

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)
